1) Implement the Binary search algorithm regarded as a fast search algorithm with run-time 
complexity of ÎŸ(log n) in comparison to the Linear Search.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of elements: ";
    cin >> n;

    int arr[n];   
    cout << " elements in sorted order:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cin >> arr[i];
  
    int a;
    cout << "Enter element to search: ";
    cin >> a;

    int l = 0, h = n - 1, m, found = -1;

    while (l <= h) {
        m = (l + h) / 2;

        if (arr[m] == a) {
            found = m;
            break;
        } else if (arr[m] < a) {
            l = m + 1;
        } else {
            h = m - 1;
        }
    }

    if (found != -1)
        cout << "Element found at index " << found << endl;
    else
        cout << "Element not found." << endl;

    return 0;
}
